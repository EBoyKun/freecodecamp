# [FreeCodeCamp]


Hello and welcome to my repository, where I store all the learning and certification projects I complete while following the [FreeCodeCamp] curriculum. If you would like to view the project I have created to obtain my certification, you can find them on my [project list page].

A little about me: I am a perfectionist, which has hindered me from finishing things I have started in the past. However, I now understand myself better and am committed to completing this curriculum to the best of my abilities and then moving on to achieve my main goal of completing my portfolio website. While I have followed other courses in the past, this is the first time I am so dedicated to finishing the curriculum and seeking a job opportunities.

I am truly thankful for [FreeCodeCamp] and all the donors who have made it possible for me and countless others to follow this amazing curriculum.

I am also grateful for [Bad Website Club]; they have organized an amazing bootcamp. I follow the hosts as they progress through the [FreeCodeCamp] curriculum, as it provides so much more context to things I did not initially understand. The hosts and the community are truly amazing.

Finally I do not own any of the projects provided by [FreeCodeCamp]. I simply utilize their curriculum to broaden my knowledge of web development. Ultimately, I aim to create my own projects to showcase my skills and seize a job opportunities.
