# [FreeCodeCamp]

Hello, welcome to my repository where I save all the learning- & certification project I complete while following the curriculum.

A bit about me. I am aperfectionist and that has hindered me to finish things I have started in the past. Now I understand myself better and will do my best to finish this curriculum and proceed to finish my main goal of completing my portfolio website. I have made other websites in the past but this is the first time I have been so serious about finishing the curriculum and looking for a job oportunity.

I don't own any of the projects that [FreeCodeCamp] provide.

I am really thankfull for [FreeCodeCamp] and all the donors that made possible for me and countles others to follow this amazing curriculum.

I also thankfull for [Bad Website Club], they made an amazing bootcamp. I follow the hosts while they go through the [FreeCodeCamp] curriculum, it give so much more context to things I did not understand initialy. The hosts and comunity are amazing.
